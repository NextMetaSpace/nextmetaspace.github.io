<h2 id="information">Information<a href="#information" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The metaverse (a portmanteau of &ldquo;meta-&rdquo; and &ldquo;universe&rdquo;) is a hypothesized iteration of the internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets. Metaverses, in some limited form, are already present on platforms like VRChat or video games like Second Life.</p>
<p>Current metaverse ambitions are centered on addressing technological limitations with modern virtual and augmented reality devices, as well as expanding the use of metaverse spaces to business, education, and retail applications. Numerous entertainment and social media companies have invested in metaverse-related research and development</p>
<h2 id="elements">Elements<a href="#elements" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Some iterations of the metaverse involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and invented economies. Additional qualities include digital persistence and synchronicity in order to better establish a sense of presence in a realistic environment. The metaverse ecosystem encompasses user-centric elements including avatar identity, content creation, virtual economy, social acceptability, presence, security and privacy, and trust and accountability.</p>
<h2 id="timeline-of-notable-developments">Timeline of notable developments<a href="#timeline-of-notable-developments" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<ul>
<li>1978 – MUDs and MOOs are multi-user virtual environments often based on a map of connected locations and described in text to the users who navigated through the environment and the puzzles with it.</li>
<li>1993 – The Metaverse was a MOO (a text-based, low-bandwidth virtual reality system) operated by Steve Jackson Games as part of their BBS, Illuminati Online.</li>
<li>1995 – Active Worlds, based entirely on Snow Crash, distributed virtual-reality worlds implementing at least the concept of the metaverse.</li>
<li>2003 – Second Life was launched by Linden Lab. The stated goal of the project was to create a user-defined world like the metaverse in which people can interact, play, do business, and otherwise communicate.</li>
<li>2004 – X3D was approved by ISO as the successor to the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) as the open standard for interactive real-time 3D (web3D). Today X3D is the standard defining the 3D web and mixed reality open metaverse by combining virtual, mirror, and augmented realities with the web.</li>
<li>2006 – Roblox was published.</li>
<li>2018 – NeosVR Metaverse was launched by Solirax.</li>
